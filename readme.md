# Zoetrope Animation Generator

## **Motivation**
The mesmerizing motion of phenakistoscopes and zoetropes showcases how still images can be brought to life with simple rotations and visual effects. These animations are historically significant in the evolution of moving pictures and remain a fascinating example of visual illusions.

Creating such animations traditionally involves a trial-and-error process, with physical prints, rotations, and camera setups. This project aims to streamline the creation and testing of zoetrope animations digitally, enabling faster experimentation and prototyping.

---

## **Project Description**
This script generates a **phenakistoscope animation** from a square input image by:
1. Extracting the central circular region.
2. Rotating the circular image into a defined number of frames (e.g., 24 for a full rotation).
3. Optionally looping the animation for a smoother playback experience.
4. Outputting the animation as an MP4 video file.

The generated video can be played to simulate a zoetrope effect or tested directly with physical setups.

## **How to Use**

### **Dependencies**
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `Pillow` (for image processing)
- `OpenCV` (for video creation)
- `numpy` (for array manipulation)

Install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pillow opencv-python-headless numpy
```

---

### **Setup**

1. **Input Image**  
   Use a square image (`.png` or `.jpg`) as input. The central circular region of the image will be used for the animation.

   Example:
   - Filename: `diceGame.png`
   - Dimensions: 500x500 (or any square resolution)

2. **Script Execution**
   Run the script by passing the input image path. By default:
   - The input file is named `diceGame.png`.
   - The output video file is generated as `diceGame_zoetrope_looped.mp4`.

---

### **Steps to Run**
1. Save the script as `createZoetropeAnimation.py`.
2. Place your input image (`diceGame.png`) in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python createZoetropeAnimation.py
   ```

---

## **Configuration**

The script provides the following customizable options:
- **Input Image Path**: Change `input_path` to your image's filename.
- **Output Video Path**: Automatically generated based on the input image name. Override if needed.
- **Number of Frames**: Default is `24` for a smooth animation.
- **Frames Per Second (FPS)**: Default is `12`. Adjust for faster or slower playback.
- **Loop Count**: Default is `5`. Increase for longer animations.

Example:
```python
create_phenakistoscope_animation(
    input_image_path="yourImage.png",
    output_video_path="yourImage_animation.mp4",
    num_frames=30,
    video_fps=24,
    loops=3
)
```

---

## **Output**
The script generates an MP4 video file, which you can preview directly or use in physical zoetrope setups.

---

## **Example Workflow**
1. Input image:  
   ![Example Image](https://via.placeholder.com/500)  
   *(Replace with your own square image)*

2. Generated video (preview on a player supporting looping):  
   Output file: `diceGame_zoetrope_looped.mp4`
